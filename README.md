A simple script that uses the [weather api](http://weatherapi.com) to automatically make picks for the Wild Weather Wednesday free pool on Draftkings.  
Meant to be run directly on the pick selection page via developer console, probably need to run twice, once to inject jQuery, and again to finish running the rest of the script.
